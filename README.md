# RFM Analysis — Custom Printing Business

## 📌 Project Purpose
This project analyses one year of customer order data for a print business operating in the custom-printing industry. The business offers products such as canvas prints, posters, flyers, and business cards. Operating as an e-commerce retailer, the company’s business model is based on direct-to-consumer online orders.

As a data analyst working at the company, the aim of this project is to answer three key business questions:

**1. Who are the best customers?**  

**2. Who needs a retention campaign?**  

**3. Which segments are safe to ignore?**

The results are intended to support marketing teams, CRM managers, and strategic decision-makers in identifying high-value customer segments and designing targeted retention campaigns.

**The Excel formulas used for the analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23548120/Formulas_RFMAnalysis.docx)**.
